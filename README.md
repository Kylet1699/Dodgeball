# Dodgeball
***

**Dec 7 8pm**

*Changes*
- Added an invisible wall in the middle that blocks agents but allows balls through. This should keep agents to their respective sides.
- Fixed bug where balls would keep moving after a game ended and their position was reset.
- Added effect to change game floor color when one team wins or looses. <- Feel free to delete this is this is distracting.
